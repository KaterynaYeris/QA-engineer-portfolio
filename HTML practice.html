         Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS Final Trailer</a>

            Elvis is <u>Baz Luhrmann's</u>biopic of <i>Elvis Presley,</i>from his childhood<br>
            to becoming a rock and <b>movie star</b>in the 1950s while maintaining a complex<br> 
            relationship with his manager, <mark>Colonel Tom Parker.</mark>

                Butler was born and raised in Anaheim, California, and the location of his childhood home was the stuff of kid fantasy: situated midway between<br>
                Disneyland and Knott’s Berry Farm. His father, David, a commercial real estate appraiser, and late mother, Lori, who ran a day care at home, divorced<br>
                amicably when Butler was seven, and Austin and his older sister, Ashley, moved fluidly between their respective houses. Though his family, by Butler’s own<br>
                admission, “didn’t have much money,” his mother would splurge on Disneyland season passes for her children and occasionally take them there for a day of hooky just because.

                At Christmas, he remembers, “I was actually driving up through Griffith Park”—gesturing to our surroundings with his large hands, a physical similarity he shares with Presley—“and<br>
                Elvis’s ‘Blue Christmas’ came on. I was singing along with it when my friend had kind of an epiphany: ‘You need to play Elvis.’ ” That friend was High School Musical alum Vanessa Hudgens,<br>
                Butler’s ex-girlfriend of nine years. Butler, who had taught himself piano and guitar at a young age, practicing the six string so much he used superglue to mend his bleeding fingers, started<br> 
                thinking about securing the rights to Presley’s life story. Then, the opportunity landed on his front step: Luhrmann was working on an Elvis script. “It felt like the stars were aligning,” Butler<br> 
                says. “I just said, I’m going to dedicate everything I have to this.”
